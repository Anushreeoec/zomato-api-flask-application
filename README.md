# zomato-api-flask-application

This is a basic flask application which shows how can Zomato API be called and its responses can be parsed.

User key for Zomato API can be generated in their official website

The application has seed data of 5 Indian states.
The first page would show the results of all restuarants in the city that has been selected.
We can scroll through all results with the previous and next buttons.

We can also search according to name of restuarant and/or cuisine.

We can book a table (not an API, just dummy, for fun!). A restuarant can take only 20 people at a time. Each booking lasts for only one hour.
To book a table, just click on the table row of the restuarant. 

The application uses Flask web framework, HTML, CSS and jQuery.
